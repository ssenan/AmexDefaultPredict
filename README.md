# Predicting Likelihood of Credit Default (Amex Kaggle)

Implementation
==============
* Notebook contains some EDA to help refresh knowledge about python data science libraries and learn more about using new graphing library plotly (https://www.kaggle.com/code/kellibelcher/amex-default-prediction-eda-lgbm-baseline code used as reference for correlation graphs)
* Prediction model focused on using single method of prediction (May update to ensemble method at later point)
* Refreshing memory on various data exploration techniques and using Plotly for graphing

Prediction Methodology
======================
* Focusing on optimizing a single model prediction method (LightGBM) and comparing to winning submissions performance
